# Excel Recipes
Formulas and operations cooked up over the years in Microsoft Excel, Power Query, PowerPivot, or VBA. There are also some notes from my experiences.

Power Pivot, Power Query, and Excel formulas are in Markdown files. There is no styling, sadly.

VBA is in .bas files. They are also available with some notes in Markdown.

Some of the formulas will be simple, others more advanced.
